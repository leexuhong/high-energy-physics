## Deacays and resonances

- The connection between the lifetime ($$\tau$$) and width ($$\Gamma$$) of a decaying state follows from the $$Uncertainty  Principle$$: $$\Delta E \Delta t \approx \hbar$$
- A particle may decay via several different channels, and the total width is the sum of the partial widths for each channel, $$\Gamma = \sum_{i} \Gamma_{i}$$, and the lifetimes of different decay channels are different 
- The decay rate of $$A$$ particle: $$\frac{dN_A}{dt}=-\frac{N_A}{\tau}=\frac{N_A}{\hbar}\Gamma$$, the number of A particle at time $$t$$ is: $$N_A(t)=N_A(0)exp(-\frac{\Gamma t}{\hbar})$$
---
- Resonance: broad states with finite widths and lifetimes, which can be formed by collision between the particles into which they decay
- The exponential time dependence determines the form of the line shape of the resonance: the energy dependence of the cross-section for creating the resonant state from its constituents is simply $$the Fourier transform$$ of the time pulse
