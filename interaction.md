## Deacays and resonances

- The connection between the lifetime ($$\tau$$) and width ($$\Gamma$$) of a decaying state follows from the $$Uncertainty  Principle$$: $$\Delta E \Delta t \approx \hbar$$
- A particle may decay via several different channels, and the total width is the sum of the partial widths for each channel, $$\Gamma = \sum_{i} \Gamma_{i}$$, and the lifetimes of different decay channels are different 
---
- Resonance: broad states with finite widths and lifetimes, which can be formed by collision between the particles into which they decay
